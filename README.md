PROBLEM STATEMENT:- In the state of mind that a common person is in during a medical emergency, it becomes difficult to take calculated decisions 
such as which hospital to rush to. This lapse of decision could mean the difference between life or death for a loved one. 
Additionally, there are several aspects to consider such as availability of the required medical facilities, medicines, blood group 
and specialists to provide the patient with a maximum chance of survival in those crucial moments. Our app aims to be the 
solution, giving the user all the necessary information during a medical emergency taking into account their location and 
requirements and providing the best-suited hospital in that hour of need.
